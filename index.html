    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>
      Since I discovered my passion for programming in 2020, I've thrown myself
      into software development learning and experimentation. I've found myself
      drawn to web development, and now after having completed many courses and
      developed a number of applications to hone my skills, I am looking for my
      first software dev role so that I can focus on my love of programming full
      time. I am a passionate, inquisitive, highly motivated, and hardworking
      individual, who is always looking to learn and improve. I am seeking to
      join a dev team of like- minded individuals, where I can make impactful
      contributions and assist with whatever needs to be done. With my outgoing
      communicative nature, I have a strong aptitude for teamwork and
      collaboration. In my hobby dev projects, I find myself coordinating dev
      work with other project contributors via Discord. Are you looking for a
      highly motivated junior dev to join your team? If so, let's chat!
